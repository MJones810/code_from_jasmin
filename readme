Readme from 30/04/14

fft_work  - contains the work to do with the fft of the KE
|         - the main file is fft_timemean.py, this code has the ability 
|           to run for any model, any region in the atmosphere averging 
|           the calcualted ffts over the region specified and over the 
|           10 day netcdf file provided. Also has the ability to put a 
|           on the graphs showing the mean over the whole month and a
|           range of values using each of the 10 days to calculate the 
|           mean.
|                -- needs to be on lotus run using 
|                   $ . bsub_fft_timemean.sh
|                -- saves the output rather than displaying
|         - the next useful file (compare_xjanp_xjlef_xjleh.py) is 
|           slightly less useful and works off monthly mean netcdf files,
|           but does simlar thing, but no range only single lines

data_conversions - contains
|    
|    T_calc - contains the code to run the calculation of T from the netCDF 
|             files containg theta and p
|           - to run the calculation run T_calc_bsub.sh (ie $ . T_calc_bsub)
|             -- output: - a netcdf file containing T for each of the 
|                            original netcdf files for theta, p
|                          - a file for the mean for each month  
|           - then when this is finished run merge_means_T.py to merge all 
|             the means for each month into a single netcdf file for the 
|             monthly mean
|
|
|
|    xjanp_conv - contains the code the extract the variables from the xjanp 
|                 ff files, currently contains u, v, p and theta. Produces
|                 a netcdf file for every original ff file and outputs the
|                 mean for each month. Outputs a log for the run.
|               - to run for example u, $ . u_calc_bsub.sh, then when 
|                 finished run merge_means_u.py
|               - unit change is just a short  code to change the units on a 
|                 netcdf file
|
|    xjlef_conv - same as for xjanp_conv but for xjlef and only for u and v 
|
|    xjleh_conv - same as for xjanp_conv but for xjleh and only for u and v 


oldCode_probs_useless - contains old code that isn't used any more but 
|                       could be useful for reference

plotting  - contains code for plotting the data from the models
|         - tempWind_plots.py contains code to plot u contours on top
|           of temperature contours
|         - zonal_mean_plots.py contains lots of code for different kinds
|           of plots (bit of a mess, but useful)
