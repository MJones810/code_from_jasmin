Readme from 22/04/14

T_calc - contains the code to run the calculation of T from the netCDF 
         files containg theta and p
       - to run the calculation run T_calc_bsub.sh (ie $ . T_calc_bsub)
           -- output: - a netcdf file containing T for each of the 
                        original netcdf files for theta, p
                      - a file for the mean for each month  
       - then when this is finished run merge_means_T.py to merge all 
         the means for each month into a single netcdf file for the 
         monthly mean

fft_work - contains the work to do with the fft of the KE
         - the main file is fft_timemean.py, this code has the ability 
           to run for any model, any region in the atmosphere averging 
           the calcualted ffts over the region specified and over the 
           10 day netcdf file provided. Also has the ability to put a 
           on the graphs showing the mean over the whole month and a
           range of values using each of the 10 days to calculate the 
           mean.
                -- needs to be on lotus run using 
                   $ . bsub_fft_timemean.sh
                -- saves the output rather than displaying
         - the next useful file (compare_xjanp_xjlef_xjleh.py) is 
           slightly less useful and works off monthly mean netcdf files,
           but does simlar thing, but no range only single lines

xjanp_conv - contains the code the extract the variables from the xjanp 
             ff files, currently contains u, v, p and theta. Produces
             a netcdf file for every original ff file and outputs the
             mean for each month. Outputs a log for the run.
           - to run for example u, $ . u_calc_bsub.sh, then when 
             finished run merge_means_u.py
           - unit change is just a short  code to change the units on a 
             netcdf file

xjlef_conv - same as for xjanp_conv but for xjlef and only for u and v 

xjleh_conv - same as for xjanp_conv but for xjleh and only for u and v 

oldCode_probs_useless - contains old code that isn't used any more but 
                        could be useful for reference

plotting - contains code for plotting the data from the models
         - tempWind_plots.py contains code to plot u contours on top
           of temperature contours
         - zonal_mean_plots.py contains lots of code for different kinds
           of plots (bit of a mess, but useful)
